Hello, I'm Esteban Freitas, I'm 18, high school student (not for long now!) interested in C, C# and Python programming.
Practicing for the Canadian Computing Competition next year! (With C, for speed!)

I'm interested in NLP, have experience with NLTK on python, RNNs (and of course normal NNs) and generative pretrained transformer models on PyTorch and Huggingface.
